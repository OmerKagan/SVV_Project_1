## Code Execution
1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/OmerKagan/SVV_Project_1.git
2. Change your current directory to the repository you just cloned.
3. Install Required Libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Execute the Code: python app.py
5. For test code execution: Run the code for a specific test case under test_codes folder while app.py is running
Note: In blocked.py test code, it waits 60 seconds to remove the block and show that user can login after that. So, waiting 60 seconds is normal.
